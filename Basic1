#### Phase 5: Course Enrollment Filtering (Weeks 5-6)

**Data Model Options**:

**Option 1: Custom Fields on Contact Object**
- **Current_Courses__c** (Multi-select Picklist)
- **Course_Status__c** (Picklist: Active, Completed, Dropped)
- **Enrollment_Date__c** (Date field)
- **Course_Category__c** (Picklist: Math, Science, Language, etc.)

**Option 2: Junction Object Approach**

- Master-Detail relationships to Contact and Course objects
- Fields: Status, Start_Date, End_Date, Course_Type, Enrollment_ID

**Filtering Implementation**:

1. **List Views Creation**:
   - Create filtered views: "Math Course Students", "Active Enrollments", "Recent Graduates"
   - Use filter logic: `(Course_Status__c = "Active") AND (Current_Courses__c INCLUDES "Mathematics")`

2. **Process Builder Integration**:
   - Trigger: Course enrollment changes
   - Action: Update contact fields automatically
   - Send automated SMS notifications for course updates

3. **Flow-Based Segmentation**:
   - Create Screen Flow for manual SMS campaigns
   - Include course enrollment filters
   - Allow bulk message sending to filtered contacts

#### Phase 6: Routing & Message Delivery (Week 6)

**Queue-Based Routing Setup**:

1. **Configure Channel Routing**:
   - Messaging Settings → Edit SMS Channel
   - Routing Type: **Omni-Queue** (Enhanced) or **Omni-Channel** (Standard)
   - Select appropriate queue for course-based routing
   - Set fallback queue for unmatched scenarios

2. **Advanced Flow Routing** (Optional):
   - Create Omni-Channel Flow using "Messages Routed to Agents and Queues" template
   - Add decision elements based on contact course data
   - Route VIP students or priority courses to specific agents
   - Configure escalation rules for unanswered messages

**Message Delivery Process**:
1. Customer sends SMS to toll-free number
2. Salesforce receives message and creates Messaging Session
3. Omni-Channel evaluates routing rules
4. Message routed to appropriate queue based on contact's course enrollment
5. Available agent receives notification and can respond
6. Conversation history maintained in Service Console

   - Execute targeted SMS campaigns to specific course groups  
   - Validate message delivery accuracy and segmentation

3. **Agent Response Workflow**:
   - Test agent acceptance of incoming conversations
   - Verify conversation history display and context
   - Validate outbound message sending and delivery confirmation

4. **Permission Validation**:
   - Test user access with different permission levels
   - Confirm proper security boundaries
   - Validate Omni-Channel widget functionality

### Key Considerations & Best Practices

**Compliance & Regulatory**:
- **SMS Carrier Filtering**: Messages may be blocked if they violate carrier policies
- **Consent Management**: Ensure proper opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- **Content Guidelines**: Avoid spam-like content that triggers filtering
- **Volume Limits**: Monitor message frequency to prevent carrier blocks

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Capacity Planning**: Configure appropriate agent capacity (recommended: 5-10 messaging sessions per agent)
- **Queue Prioritization**: Set queue priorities based on course importance or student tier
- **Response Time SLAs**: Configure escalation rules for timely responses

**Security & Access Control**:
- Use principle of least privilege for permission assignments
- Regular audit of user access and permission sets
- Implement proper data classification for student information
- Enable two-factor authentication for admin users

### Success Metrics & KPIs
