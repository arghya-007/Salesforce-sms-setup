# Salesforce SMS Broadcast System - Proof of Concept Document

## Executive Summary

This Proof of Concept (PoC) outlines the implementation of a comprehensive SMS broadcasting system in Salesforce to support **10 distinct courses**, with each course having its own dedicated SMS channel for targeted communication with registered contacts. The solution leverages Salesforce's Enhanced SMS messaging capabilities to deliver personalized, course-specific communications while maintaining compliance and consent management.

## Problem Statement

The organization needs to communicate effectively with contacts registered for various courses through SMS broadcasts. The current challenge is establishing a scalable system that can:

- Manage **10 separate SMS channels** for individual courses
- Send targeted broadcasts based on course registration
- Maintain proper consent and compliance management
- Track engagement and delivery metrics
- Ensure message personalization using Salesforce data

## Solution Overview

### Core Components

**Enhanced SMS Channels**
- **10 dedicated SMS channels** using Enhanced SMS messaging capability
- Each channel mapped to a specific course with unique phone numbers
- Support for both one-to-one and broadcast messaging

**Campaign Management**
- Course-specific SMS campaigns linked to respective channels
- Automated triggers based on contact registration status
- Template-based messaging with dynamic content insertion

**Data Architecture**
- Custom objects for course registration tracking
- Contact segmentation based on course enrollment
- Consent management through communication subscriptions

## Technical Architecture

### SMS Channel Configuration

**Channel Setup Requirements**
1. **Enhanced SMS Channel Creation**: 10 separate enhanced channels through Messaging Settings
2. **Phone Number Acquisition**: Dedicated long codes for each course (US/Canadian numbers)
3. **Brand Registration**: Individual brand setup per channel for compliance
4. **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**: Required for each phone number registration

### Data Model Design

**Core Objects**
- **Course__c**: Master course record with SMS channel mapping
- **Course_Registration__c**: Junction object linking Contacts to Courses
- **SMS_Campaign__c**: Campaign tracking for each course
- **MessagingUser**: Auto-created for SMS interactions
- **MessagingSession**: Individual conversation tracking

**Key Fields**(For demo purpose only, will change based on actual project structure)
```
Course__c:
- Name (Text)
- SMS_Channel_ID__c (Text)
- Phone_Number__c (Phone)
- Active__c (Checkbox)

Course_Registration__c:
- Contact__c (Lookup to Contact)
- Course__c (Lookup to Course__c)
- Registration_Date__c (Date)
- SMS_Consent__c (Checkbox)
- Status__c (Picklist)
```

### Integration Points

**Campaign Builder Integration**
- Process Builder triggers for automated SMS campaigns
- Flow-based enrollment and messaging logic
- Real-time consent verification before sending

**Marketing Cloud Integration** (if applicable)
- Mobile Studio for advanced campaign management
- Cross-channel campaign coordination
- Advanced segmentation capabilities

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

**Step 1: Channel Creation**
1. Navigate to Setup → Messaging Settings
2. Create 10 Enhanced SMS channels following the process:
   - Click "New Channel" → "Start" → "SMS Text Messaging"
   - Select "Enhanced" channel type
   - Complete LOA forms for each number
   - Submit support cases for activation (we do not have to worry about this as it will be done by the client as discussed in the meeting)

**Step 2: Data Model Implementation (For demo/refference purpose only)**
1. Create custom objects (Course__c, Course_Registration__c)
2. Configure field-level security and permissions
3. Set up validation rules and workflows
4. Create list views and page layouts

### Phase 2: Channel Configuration

**SMS Channel Setup**
- Configure consent keywords (START, STOP, HELP)
- Set up auto-response templates
- Map communication subscriptions to channels
- Test basic send/receive functionality

**Course-Channel Mapping**
- Assign unique phone numbers to each course
- Configure channel-specific templates
- Set up routing rules for incoming messages

### Phase 3: Campaign Development

**Template Creation**
- Course-specific message templates with merge fields
- Welcome messages for new registrations
- Reminder messages for course activities
- Emergency/urgent communication templates

**Automation Setup**
- Process Builder flows for registration triggers
- Scheduled campaigns for recurring communications
- Consent verification workflows

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

**Functional Testing**
- End-to-end message delivery testing
- Consent management validation
- Template personalization verification
- Error handling and edge case testing

**Performance Testing**
- Bulk message sending capabilities
- Concurrent channel usage
- System performance under load

## Resource Requirements

### Salesforce Licensing
- **Service Cloud Enterprise/Unlimited** with Digital Engagement add-on
- Or **Marketing Cloud Growth/Advanced** with SMS capabilities
- Enhanced SMS messaging licenses: **$75/user/month**

### Technical Resources
- ......
### Infrastructure Costs
- **10 SMS Long Codes**: ~$1,000-$2,000 setup costs (Referrence purpose only)
- **Monthly SMS Messaging**: Variable based on volume
- **Salesforce Support Cases**: For channel activation (included in licensing)

## Compliance and Security

### Consent Management
- **Opt-in/Opt-out Processing**: Automated handling through communication subscriptions
- **TCPA Compliance**: Required consent verification before messaging
- **Data Privacy**: Contact preference management and audit trails

### Security Measures
- **Field-Level Security**: Restricted access to sensitive SMS data
- **API Security**: Secure integration endpoints for third-party tools
- **Audit Trail**: Complete messaging history and compliance tracking

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios

**Registration Flow Testing**
1. Contact registers for Course A → Receives welcome SMS from Course A channel
2. Contact registers for multiple courses → Receives separate messages from respective channels
3. Contact opts out from Course B → No longer receives Course B messages but continues receiving Course A messages

**Campaign Broadcasting**
1. Send bulk message to all Course C registrants
2. Verify delivery status and engagement tracking
3. Test message personalization with contact data

**Edge Cases**
- Invalid phone numbers handling
- Duplicate registrations
- Consent withdrawal scenarios
- Channel capacity limits

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Channel Setup Success**: 10/10 channels operational.
- **Message Delivery Rate**: >95% successful delivery
- **Consent Compliance**: 100% verified opt-in before messaging
- **Response Time**: Automated responses within 5 minutes
- **User Adoption**: 80% of eligible contacts opted-in within 30 days
- (All above data are for refrence purpose only)

### Monitoring and Reporting
- **Daily Delivery Reports**: Per-channel message statistics
- **Engagement Analytics**: Open rates, response rates, click-through rates
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Consent status and opt-out tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: System response times and error rates
- (All above data are for refrence purpose only)

## Risk Assessment
......
### Technical Risks
......

### Business Risks
- **Compliance Violations**: Potential TCPA/CAN-SPAM violations
  - *Mitigation*: Robust consent management and legal review
- **User Experience**: Poor message targeting leading to opt-outs
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout


This Proof of Concept demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a robust, scalable SMS broadcasting system in Salesforce that can effectively manage communications across 10 distinct courses while maintaining compliance and delivering personalized experiences to registered contacts
